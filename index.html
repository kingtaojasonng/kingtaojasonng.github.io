                    <p><b>Experience</b><br>

                    <p>I am a Senior Data Scientist at <a href="https://asic.gov.au">ASIC</a>, focusing on machine learning and natural language processing applications. Previously, I was a Senior Analytics Platform Owner at ASIC, managing Databricks, RStudio Servers, Python Servers, and the Data Science Lab. Before that, as a Data Scientist at ASIC, I led the development and implementation of NLP Prospectuses, leveraging NLP to extract insights and enhance document analysis. As a Data Scientist at the <a href="https://www.sydney.edu.au">University of Sydney's</a> <a href="https://www.sydney.edu.au/engineering/schools/school-computer-science.html">School of Computer Science</a>, I developed a Researcher Collaboration Recommendation System. Before becoming a data scientist, I worked as a Business Analyst at <a href="https://www.tabcorp.com.au">Tabcorp</a>, overseeing the Customer Loyalty Project, and as a Software Engineer at <a href="https://www.aristocrat.com">Aristocrat</a>, developing slot machine applications.</p>

                    <p><b>Education</b><br>

					<p>I completed a Master of Research at <a href="https://www.mq.edu.au">Macquarie University</a> under the supervision of <a href="http://web.science.mq.edu.au/~diego/">Diego Molla-Aliod</a>, <a href="http://web.science.mq.edu.au/~rolfs/">Rolf Schwitter</a>, and <a href="https://researchers.mq.edu.au/en/persons/houying-zhu">Houying Zhu</a>, with a <a href="https://figshare.mq.edu.au/ndownloader/files/44817199">dissertation</a> focused on Bayesian statistics and natural language processing. Prior to this, I earned a Master of Data Science from the University of Sydney, where I collaborated with <a href="https://profiles.uts.edu.au/Roman.Marchant">Roman Marchant</a>, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sunchao/?originalSubdomain=au">Chao Sun</a>, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/philhenville/">Phil Henville</a> on my research <a href="papers/academic_capability_mapping.pdf">project</a>. I also hold a Master of Economics from the University of Sydney, as well as a Master’s in Information Technology and a Bachelor’s in Computer Science from the <a href="https://www.unsw.edu.au">University of New South Wales</a>.</p>

                    <p><b>Research</b><br>
                    <p>My research primarily focuses on Bayesian statistics as a framework for understanding causality, with a particular emphasis on unstructured data. I am interested in developing probabilistic models that can infer causal relationships.</p>
                    
                    <p><b>Who am I</b><br>
                    <p>I was born and raised in Hong Kong, where I spent the first 18 years of my life. After high school, I came to Australia for my studies, initially thinking it would be a short stay. But as time passed, I found a full-time job, and I decided to settle in Australia. I attended St. Margaret’s College in Hong Kong, though the school closed down after I left. I attended <a href="https://www.kcis.edu.hk/">Kiangsu and Chekiang Primary School</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.npgps.edu.hk">North Point Government Primary School</a>. I have heard, though it is not entirely confirmed, that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacky_Cheung">Jacky Cheung</a> is an alumnus of North Point Government Primary School.</p>

                <strong>Product Management</strong><br/>
                Have you ever developed an application requested by the business, only to find it is never used after implementation? If so, I would recommend the following books to read:
                <ul>

                <strong>Bayesian Statistics</strong><br/>
                I see myself primarily as a computer scientist, with some experience in data science, but not as a statistician. However, learning Bayesian statistics, from my perspective, can be challenging since many resources are geared toward trained statisticians. I have found the following materials to be particularly accessible:
                <ul>
                <li class="paper" words="add, your, keywords, here">This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEFxFVESQXc">YouTube</a> video explains very clearly between Bayesian and Frequentist.</li>
